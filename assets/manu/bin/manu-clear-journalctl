# 1. Rotate journals: marks current active journal files as archive
# and starts new ones. This makes current logs eligible for vacuuming.
sudo journalctl --rotate

# 2. Vacuum system journals: remove all archived system logs older than 1 second.
sudo journalctl --vacuum-time=1s

# 3. Vacuum user journals: specifically target user-level archived logs.
sudo journalctl --user --vacuum-time=1s

# Optional: Notification (useful when launched from a menu like Walker)
if command -v notify-send >/dev/null; then
  notify-send "System Maintenance" "Journals have been cleared successfully."
